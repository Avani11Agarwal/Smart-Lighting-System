# Smart-Lighting-System
Made as a part of CS F241 (Microprocessor Programming & Interfacing) course under Dr. Anupama K. R.

Problem Statement:
This is a lighting system for a conference room. As the seats get filled the light should be turned on. The rows are filled from row1 onwards. There are 4 lights per row. As each row begins to get filled the lights get turned on. As each rows empties completely the light gets turned off. You can assume there are at least 5 rows. Entry to the auditorium is restricted to a certain point of time. Exit can be at any point of time.
